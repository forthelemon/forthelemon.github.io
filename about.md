**What is a lemon?**
A lemon is a person whose genetics, or other factors out of their control, create a body/mind that requires constant thought, care, and maintenance. 
Usually a lemon has more than one condition or disease. To be a lemon is to not know what’s causing the pain this time. 

A lemon is also the term for a car that is always falling apart, but no one can connect the dots, figure out why, or fix its core problems. 

Being a lemon doesn’t, I repeat _doesn’t_ make you good or bad or reflect on your character in any way. 
 

**Why am I a lemon?**
I am a lemon because I have multiple autoimmune and other chronic diseases that cause me to live in constant pain and “break down” from conditions difficult to distinguish from one another. I am constantly “in the shop” or, in human terms: stretching in bed. 

I am a lemon because people respond to my health news with eyerolls and “what is it this time”’s and generally less empathy than other, non-lemon, humans might garner from the same complaints. 

I am a lemon because my health is suffering and the world is moving faster than I can pick myself up.

I am a lemon because I have to write my own rulebook for this body, mostly because it’s just so damn weird. 

_Gathering and sharing collective support and sharing stories are vital practices for the survival of a lemon, and a community in the chaos of chronic illness can help make the difficulties of lemon life a bit less constraining and certainly less lonely. This blog is a place for me to be a lemon openly and curiously; to share thoughts, theory, poetry, stories, and recipes._
