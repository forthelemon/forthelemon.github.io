I am Zahava M Beet. I grew up in Washington, DC, attended school in Brooklyn New York, and currently live in St. Petersburg, Fl; where I had never visited until the day I moved in. I moved here in a state of crisis, but I know that's misleading if you don't understand the role chaos and crisis has played in my daily life. 

I was diagnosed with CRPS, a chronic pain condition that stems from a malfunctioning autonomic nerve system at injury onset, when I was ten, in 2005. 

They’ve recently confirmed that, after a few years, CRPS becomes an autoimmune condition, becoming much more permanent and more invasive to other systems of digestion, hormone regulation, bone density, circulation, etc. I have it over most of my body. I also live with several other autoimmune and related diseases: gastroparesis, bipolar II, generalized anxiety and PTSD, neuropathy and carpal tunnel, hashimoto's thyroiditis, psoriasis, as well as several heart issues.

Growing up everyone wanted to ignore what I was dealing with in order to prepare me for success. They had confidence in my ability to ‘get through’ anything so they assumed that my future wouldn’t include illness. But what they didn’t see was that I wasn’t getting through anything. I was helpless struggling through, using all my energy to maintain flare up after flare up, without family support. But they saw my miraculous on-time high school graduation as proof that I could meet their standards. They didn’t see that I didn’t have a social life or participate in after school activities, or internship I was barely able to participate in and almost didn’t get credit for. They saw and celebrated the achievement, but they don’t acknowledge the battles and serious sacrifices I made. 

Because of this, my family hasn’t really acknowledged that I am seriously disabled. They haven’t allowed this part of my identity to merge with their understanding of who I am, resulting in their undervaluing the role of my health in my life. 

When I was 12-13 I was in a wheelchair. My dad made me use my grandfather’s manual chair which I couldn’t operate on my own. The chair, which was half broken and was about four sizes too big for me, took me to middle school, where an aid had to drive me around. I wondered about a chair that at least fit me, even if I couldn’t drive it, but my family didn’t want to “encourage” my disability. What it nurtured was a deep shame about who I was and an ultimatum-like internalisation of how my ability to function physically was tied to my relationships with my family. I didn’t want to be back in a wheelchair. When I was thirteen and my legs were in a state of some remission, I promised myself I would never be dependent on a wheelchair again. But slowly, as college started, my legs started losing control. Unexplained weakness and excruciating pain built up, and soon I had to convince myself through each step to the bathroom, drug myself with weed as my doctors completely and suddenly cut my pain med prescription.  Every single outing, including class was done in a state of out-of-my-mind in pain or out-of-my-mind-high. 

Eventually, several events caused the complete flare up of my right leg, and my arms aren’t much better off. I am now once again in a wheelchair, and have been since September, 2018. And I even graduated from college at the end of that Fall semester. But again I had to get, push, forced myself through my education as fast and as thoughtlessly as I possibly could. 

I saw that as the measure of my success; that I could do what they wanted and survive it. If I could do this then I would be successful to their standard. But then I realize I got through it, my education, and now I was their worst nightmare, something they didn’t expect because they rejected it’s role in my life for so long. I am a disabled, unemployable adult, who can barely leave my home. I am not successful or happy to my own standard and many have made it clear that I am certainly not successful to theirs. But I am not to blame for my physical condition, or the progression of my disease. 

I was pulled out of school constantly for physical rehab programs, I spent my childhood doing stretches and forcing myself through grueling work that sometimes helped my mobility, but rarely helped my pain levels. I was forced to prioritise my health and I took it on. 

My situation isn’t because I didn’t work hard in physical therapy, or open my mind to atypical treatments. The current state of my body isn’t human error on my part. I have always been dedicated to eating right, to feeling better. I’ve spent the last 14 years in excruciating pain, why wouldn’t I be the most dedicated hardworking person possible to solve this? 

I have been learning that I have to hold my limits, especially to the people who won’t respect them. Sometimes that includes myself. I have to get more comfortable with my resolve, I was when I was younger. I wasn’t raised to accept these parts of myself, but I know what I needed to be lifted up and to see the success in myself, no matter my physical ability. 

I know what I needed because I share this experience with so many other disabled and neuro-divergent people in my life. People who deserve that encouragement, support, and most importantly respect. People that think I deserve it too.

I can’t alter the ableist environment I was raised in. I can’t completely undo the complexes I have around my disabilities, my pain, and my worth. I have already done work in these areas, I’ve been combating these patterns since they originated, but my shame and insistence on educating the unsupportive people in my life held me back from fully stepping into the fold of my chaotic self distrust. 

If I acknowledge, ascertain the source of, and redirect the pathways of my defensive and anxious tendencies, my ability to accept myself and the space I take up in the world might be expanded…
My hope is that I can raise myself in a way I know to be better, and nurture myself how I want to nurture the world.

Through the writing of this blog, I hope to untangle some of these processes by giving myself the freedom to ramble, use unlimited form, and not overly divide things that feel connected to me for the sake of creating a simple reading.
